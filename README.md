## Project Description

This project involves analyzing a weather dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. The primary focus is on exploring various aspects of the data, such as unique values, frequency counts, and statistical measures. The analysis includes the following tasks:

- Loading and exploring the dataset.
- Identifying unique values and data types.
- Counting occurrences of specific weather conditions.
- Filtering data based on specific criteria.
- Renaming columns for better readability.
- Calculating statistical measures like mean, standard deviation, and variance.
- Grouping data and finding minimum and maximum values for each weather condition.

## Installation

To run the notebook and perform the analysis, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the required Python libraries.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-data-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Data-Analysis-on-Weather-Dataset
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open `Project 1 - Weather data analysis.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load the weather dataset using Pandas.
